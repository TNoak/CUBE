# CUBE

CUBE is a program written in Java that can read and write data over a serial port (e.g.: USB) to a microcontroller. In this case, to the ATmega328P, which is also used in the Arduino Uno Rev 3. The software is specially designed to display data provided by the DHT22 Sensor that is capable of gathering temperature and humidity information.
CUBE will be used to analyze a miniature rebuilt of a classroom by collecting data about its thermal structure. 
The goal of this project is to find weak points in the real building to find out how you could improve temperature and humidity values.


We use our CUBE software written in Java to read and display the output of a few sensors connected to an 
arduino.
